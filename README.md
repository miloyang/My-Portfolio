# Coding Bootcamp: Week 2 - Creating a Professional Portfolio

## Description

This challenge allows the bootcamp students to showcase our skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. It will set us up for future success by applying the core advanced CSS skills we've recently learned this week.

When you click on the links to the section about my work, the UI will scroll to a section with titled images of my applications. 
When you click on the images of the applications, you will be taken to that deployed application. 
The page will have a responsive layout that adapts the viewport, when you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.
